              <p>This webside will not deceive you. At least not intentionally. I do not claim
                credit for building the AI system, that credit goes to OpenAI. I do not take 
                full credit for writing this choreoscript, nor do I attribute it wholly to the AI.
                I do not take credit for the music, nor the projector, nor the computer, nor the keyboard,
                nor the web hosting, nor the browser from which you view this website, nor much of anything.
                Like any authentic artistic collaboration, it is impossible to separate exactly who
                gets credit for what. The best I will provide in tracing the origin of this piece is a mildly edited video
                of a small part of the processes of creation. Is this trace in and of itself art?
                The music you hear played live in the room,
                so I am loosely bound to the one true arrow of time in my editing.
              </p>

              <p>Pardon the excessive adjectives, they help encourage the AI to produce good work.</p>

          Following a choreoscript to the letter is not my specialty as a dancer and, 
          unfortunately, the screen recording failed to capture the projected output. 
          Here is what we have

          <div class="row">
            <div class="column">
              <!-- style="background-color:#aaa;" -->
              <!-- <h2>Column 1</h2> -->
              <p>This is an, alluring, bewitching, captivating, charming, enchanting, enthralling, mesmerizing, spellbinding, tantalizing, irresistible choreography for a single dancer—Lilith—utilizing a digital canvas that allows her to loop repeat and reshape her image in real time. The choreography is as follows:</p>

              <p>Part 1:</p>

              <p>Lilith stands at the center of the stage. She is wearing a long black skirt and red shirt. She has her arms outstretched, and her head is tilted back. She begins to spin, and as she does, her image begins to multiply and distort. She appears to be in multiple places at once, and her movements become more and more erratic. She seems to be in a trance, and her movements become increasingly wild.</p>

              <p>As the music builds to a climax, Lilith's image begins to fragment and shatter. She appears to be in pain, and her movements become increasingly desperate. Finally, she collapses to the ground, and her image echos endlessly.</p>

              <p>Part 2:</p>

              <p>Lilith's image gradually begins to reform, and she slowly gets to her feet. She looks around confused, and her movements are hesitant and uncertain. She doesn't seem to know where she is or what she's doing.</p>

              <p>As she begins to explore her surroundings, her movements become more purposeful. She starts to experiment with her image, and she gradually becomes more confident. She begins to play with her image, stretching and twisting it in different ways.</p>

              <p>Eventually, she starts to dance again, and her movements are more fluid and graceful. She appears to be lost in the moment. Her image begins to multiply and distort once again, but this time, she seems to be in control.</p>

              <p>The music builds to another climax, and Lilith's image shatters once again. But this time, she reforms almost immediately. She looks around with a satisfied smile, and her image echos endlessly.</p>
